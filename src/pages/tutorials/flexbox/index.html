title: Flex Box

<p>
  A CSS flex box is an essential building block of HTML layouts, as it can
  create rows or columns and transition between the two.
</p>

<p>First, add a div with a class name of "flex" to your HTML:</p>

{% highlight "html" %}
<div class="flex"></div>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>In your CSS, we'll add a class called 'flex':</p>
{% highlight "css" %} .flex{ display: flex; } {% endhighlight %}
<p>
  Using a class to handle a specific property like this is often called a
  "utility" class. Instead of baking the behavior into a specific layout
  element, we can tag anything we want to behave with this simple selector.
</p>
<p>
  Now, any child elements you add to this container will behave as columns. For
  instance, to create a two-column layout:
</p>

{% highlight "html" %}
<div class="flex">
  <div>1</div>
  <div>2</div>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  These child containers will only span the width of their contents, however,
  you can
</p>
